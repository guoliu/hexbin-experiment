# hexbin-experiment

This repo contains preliminary work developed for a data visualization experiment (work in progress)

The data visualization community tends to be fairly opinionated about the proper way to present data.
As many previous researchers have commented, more empirical evidence should be considered over
intuition.  While many contributions have been made in this direction, there is more to be done
making data visualization an evidence based practice.

This project attempts to contribute to this trajectory by exploring data displayed as hexbins or
as scatterplots.  We intend to take the same dataset and render it for A/B groups using the two
different visualization techniques.  We will then test for comprehension of the data as a means of
evaluating which technique is more effective at communicating visual information under specific
circumstances.
